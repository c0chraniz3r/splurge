# SPLURGE — Law of Attraction Money Manifesting Game (BASIC Port)

## Overview

**SPLURGE** is a simple yet powerful money manifesting game inspired by the Law of Attraction philosophy. Originally created as a minimalist Bash one-liner by me, this version is a universal BASIC port expanded by ChatGPT to help retro enthusiasts run the game on classic platforms.

## History of the Law of Attraction

The Law of Attraction is a centuries-old metaphysical idea rooted in early Hermetic philosophy, emphasizing that your thoughts, feelings, and intentions influence the reality you experience. Modern New Thought writers like Napoleon Hill popularized the concept, promoting the belief that focusing on abundance, gratitude, and positive expectation can attract success and prosperity.

SPLURGE is designed as a mindset game: by repeatedly imagining what you would spend a randomly generated amount of money on, it encourages you to cultivate an abundance mindset, enhance creativity, and reinforce positive thinking in a fun, addictive cycle.

## About This BASIC Port

This BASIC version of SPLURGE was **ported entirely by ChatGPT** from the original Bash script and expanded for portability across a wide range of retro platforms. Because of the diversity of BASIC dialects, some modifications may be required for the game to run perfectly on specific systems.

## Original Bash One-Liner

The SPLURGE concept began as a simple Bash one-liner:

```bash
clear ; for (( ; ; )) ; do read -p '$'$RANDOM': ' ; done
```

This minimalist script repeatedly prompts the player with a random dollar amount and lets them type what they would spend it on — creating a rapid, addictive manifestation exercise.

ChatGPT expanded this idea into the full BASIC port you see here, adding a title screen, history, custom ranges, and graceful exit handling.

## How to Play

1. Set your custom minimum and maximum dollar range.
2. The game will display a random dollar amount within that range.
3. Type what you would spend the amount on and press Enter.
4. Repeat as often as you like, letting your imagination and abundance mindset grow!

## Notes

* This version aims to be as generic and portable as possible, but minor tweaks may be necessary depending on your BASIC interpreter or retro hardware.
* Feel free to fork, adapt, and expand the game to suit your platform or add your own creative touches!
