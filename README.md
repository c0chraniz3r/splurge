# SPLURGE
SPLURGE is a retro-friendly Law of Attraction money game written in universal BASIC. You receive a random dollar amount, imagine what you’d spend it on, and repeat. Designed for portability across classic systems, SPLURGE helps spark creativity, abundance thinking, and fun rapid-fire play. Feel free to modify the code to fit the needs of whatever retro computer or platform you choose.
